# admin-dashboard
This project is part of [The Odin Project's Full Stack JavaScript course - Intermediate HTML and CSS](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/intermediate-html-and-css). 

Itâ€™s a recreation of an [admin dashboard layout design](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/43cc6ab69fdfbef40d431a65677d2144668930ac/intermediate_html_css/grid/project_admin_dashboard/imgs/dashboard-project.png). In this version, I added my own customizations, such as slightly different colors esp. for what I considered to be a left border, layout adjustments, etc.

## Technologies Used  
- **HTML**: Provides the structural foundation.  
- **CSS**: Handles styling, layout etc.
